			| Expected Kills
		p Expected Kills, shortened to xKills sums up the probability that a player gets the kill in each kill and death they participated in. If a player had a 67% chance to get a kill, that would equal 0.67 xKills. This quantifies how many times the average player would have gotten the kill in that situation.
		h1(class="Title") 
			| Round Impact 
		p Round Impact , shortened to RI is the sum of the round win probability change that occured due to all the kills and deaths a player participated in. Getting 2 kills that increase your team's chances of winning a round by 25% would be 0.5 RI, and then dying which then causes a -30% swing would be a total of 0.2 RI. This quantifies how a player's actions ACTUALLY changed their teams round win chances.
		h1(class="Title") 
			| Expected Round Impact
		p Expected Round Impact, shortened to xRI combines xKills and RI, it takes the probability of a play being successful, multiplied by the change in round win probability the play had. This is added up for each kill event a player partook in. A 67% chance to get a kill that changes the round win % by 25 would be 0.1675 xRI. This quantifies many rounds a player's actions SHOULD HAVE gained for their team compared to the average pro, given their situation. It is slightly off, due to xRI not being correctly calculated when a player loses a duel (you would need to predict the RI of the world where the kill goes the other way, and I just don't have the resources for that ATM), but it is a good enough indicator for wheter or not player are making good decisions.

			| Expected Kills
		p Expected Kills, shortened to xKills sums up the probability that a player gets the kill in each kill and death they participated in. If a player had a 67% chance to get a kill, it would equal 0.67 xKills. This quantifies how many times the average player would have gotten the kill.
		h1(class="Title") 
			| Round Win Probability Added
		p Round Win Probability Added, shortened to rWPA is the sum of the round win probability change that occured due to all the kills and deaths a player participated in. Getting 2 kills that increase your team's chances of winning a round by 25% would be 0.5 rWPA, and then dying which causes a -30% swing would be 0.2 rWPA total. This quantifies how much a player's actions ACTUALLY affected their team's win chances.
		h1(class="Title") 
			| Expected Round Win Probability Added
		p Expected Round Win Probability Added, shortened to XrWPA combines xKills and rWPA, it takes the probability of a play being successful, multiplied by the change in round win probability the play had. This is added up for each kill event a player partook in. 67% chance to get a kill that changes the round win % by 25 would be 0.1675 XrWPA. This quantifies how much a players actions SHOULD have affected their teams win chances.
